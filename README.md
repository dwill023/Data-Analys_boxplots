## Making box-plots 

A good way to compare between samples from a Next-generation sequencing (NGS) run is to use box-plots. They are prepared from the normalized read counts. This helps to visualize the fold-changes generated from RNA-seq or microarray analysis. 

An example of box-plots generated with plotly can be seen here:
