## Making box-plots 

A good way to compare between samples from a Next-generation sequencing (NGS) run is to use box-plots. They are prepared from the normalized read counts. This helps to visualize the fold-changes generated from RNA-seq or microarray analysis. 

Below is an example of a box-plot generated with [plotly](https://plotly.com/).

The above plot was prepared in python. See [here](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/dwill023/Data-Analys_boxplots/blob/d4e177911a0758a1583cd618c082d907fb5ad57e/box-plots_plotly.ipynb) for the steps.

Boxplots using R (see above for Rmd file) is also visually pleasing and informative.
